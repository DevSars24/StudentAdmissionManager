# College Admission System

## Overview
This is a **mini project** developed in C++ to demonstrate the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) principles in a College Admission System. The project is designed for revision and learning purposes, showcasing the four pillars of OOPs—Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism—through a simple system that manages student data, checks admission eligibility, and processes course allocations.

The repository contains two main files:
1. **OOPs Template (revision)**: A file demonstrating the basic templates and explanations of the four OOPs pillars.
2. **College Admission System (implementation)**: A complete mini project implementing a college admission system using OOPs concepts.

## Features
- **Student Data Management**: Store and manage student details like name, roll number, and marks.
- **Eligibility Check**: Verify student eligibility for UG or PG courses based on marks.
- **Course-Specific Admission**: Different admission processes for UG and PG courses.
- **OOPs Concepts Demonstrated**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Private data (e.g., student details) with public getters/setters.
  - **Abstraction**: Abstract `Admission` class to hide complex eligibility logic.
  - **Inheritance**: `Student` and `Admin` classes inherit from a `Person` base class.
  - **Polymorphism**: Different admission processes for UG and PG via virtual functions.
